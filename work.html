                        <p>
                            This project was to build the citizen website and portal for Barnet Council, closely following <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">GDS guidelines</a> for usability and accessibility.</p>
                        <p>I had various roles across this project, largely as the lead front-end developer, but also designer and UX. Main main role was to build HTML templates, create the corresponding styles and maintain the style guide. I also made many user centered design decisions, firstly alongside a UX designer, then as the sole UX resource. This was an agile run project where I worked alongside UX designers/researchers, developers, testers, project managers, and analysts to help build barnet.gov.uk piece by piece in a continuous release cycle.

                        <p>
                            In this project, I built the quote page for the Tesco car insurance site, integrating complex functionality and code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked in a purely front-end developer capacity for this project, working on a Java based platform to build the templates and client side functionality. This included complex JavaScript code, HTML and LessCSS based template building, and incorporating the functionality with the existing back-end setup. This was a self managed project in a waterfall style, where I had a set of requirements and a deadline by which to finish.

                        <p>
                            For this project, we were asked to restyle the Reed Salary Guide, so I was asked to provide concepts for a "refresh" of the current design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My role in this was to provide various concepts (created in Photoshop) to refresh the look of the existing salary guide, whilst not changing the core functionality or creating too much change for the developers. I put forward a new color scheme and some redesigned assets which the client was happy with, and the design was integrated shortly after.

                            I was full stack designer/developer whilst working on this, from designing concepts for sign off from the client to full build and release. This site was design fully responsive after checking analytics on the previous site and discussing with the client that the majority of the sites users were using a handheld device. This site now attracts over 500 users a month and over a 1,000 page views, which we have considered a huge success for this small business.

                            I was solely responsible for the maintenance of this and several other insurance websites, implementing any changes requested by the client. This encompassed all contact with the client, estimating, development, and liaising with testers and project managers to achieve sign off. I personally maintained and managed these sites very successfully for over 10 months, swiftly turning around live bugs and quickly implementing requesting amends.

                            For several months I was the lead designer/front-end developer on this site and various micro sites associated with it. I mainly implemented code changes to templates and style changes, but also oversaw a full re-brand and the implementation of a brand new login functionality within the site. Alongside these responsibilities I also maintained the site, clearing up all raised bugs and ensuring there were no style or client-side issues.
